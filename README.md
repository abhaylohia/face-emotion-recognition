<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The suggested system's main goal is to detect the user's facial expressions and extract facial landmarks based on those expressions, which are then categorized to determine the user's sentiment. The majority of music recommendation algorithms are based on user ratings and acoustic characteristics of the songs. These methods are incapable of dealing with the cold start issue or rating diversity. Furthermore, music choices will be modified based on the users' current mood.


<!-- Python Libraries Used -->

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

After the image classification, we could successfully and accurately identify the emotion of the person.

The different emotions are Happy, Sad, Fearful.
